# AzureOTTSolver
- Thinking about small wiki projects just yet. Want to study much tech stacks as possible.

* Ruby version
2.7.3

* System dependencies
ruby / rails
look up replit.nix to get dependency information 

* How to run the test suite
using rails minitest

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
NONE yet.

* TODO
1. install turbo correctly
2. make more tests
3. install bootstrap to look things good
4. gather more ideas about this project
5. postgresql?
Z. rake version error correction(currently out of ideas)
